 # Hello, I'm Aditya Rahman Sidqi! ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a Backend Developer with experience in building microservice-based applications using technologies like **Java Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, **Kubernetes**, and various other tools.  

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge and diving into the **Rust** programming language.  
Rust fascinates me with its focus on performance, memory safety, and modern system-level programming. Iâ€™m learning Rust through [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies and Tools I Use  
- **Back-End**: Java (Spring Boot), Rust  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Redis  
- **DevOps**: Kubernetes, Docker, Minikube  
- **Frontend**: [Planned: Flutter for Web and Mobile Apps]  
- **Event Streaming**: Kafka  
- **Search**: Elasticsearch  

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus  
- Deepening my knowledge of **Rust** to build efficient and secure applications.  
- Developing an **e-commerce application** with a **microservices** architecture and modern features like **CQRS** and **circuit breaker**.  
- Enhancing my expertise with technologies like **Keycloak** for identity management and **Oracle Database** for enterprise solutions.  

## ðŸ’¡ Fun Facts  
- Iâ€™m exploring how to integrate **Rust** with the technologies I already master.  
- My mission is to combine modern technologies to build scalable and user-friendly applications.
